    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 15 August 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Wherostr ("we", "our", or "us"). Your privacy is of utmost
      importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use,
      disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our decentralized
      social network app built on the Nostr protocol.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Given the decentralized nature of Nostr, we collect minimal personal data.
      However, we may gather the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Public Information:</strong> This includes any data you choose
        to broadcast publicly via the Nostr network, such as your profile
        information, posts, and interactions with others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Identifiers:</strong> Nostr utilizes public and private
        keys as user identifiers. Your public key may be used by others to
        follow your activity on the network.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect may be used in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>To Facilitate Network Operations:</strong> Your public
        information and user identifiers are used to ensure seamless
        interactions within the decentralized network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To Improve User Experience:</strong> We may use anonymized data
        to analyze usage trends and improve app functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Due to the decentralized nature of Nostr:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Public Data:</strong> Any information you broadcast on Nostr is
        inherently public and may be viewed by anyone with access to the
        network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party Relays:</strong> Nostr relies on third-party relays
        to distribute data. While these relays may have their own privacy
        practices, they do not control the data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize the security of your information. However, given the
      decentralized architecture, you are responsible for safeguarding your
      private keys. We strongly advise against sharing your private keys with
      anyone.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      As a user of a decentralized network, you maintain control over your data.
      You can choose which information to broadcast and have the ability to
      delete or modify your data at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or
      legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the app and will
      take effect immediately.
    </p>
